## Individual Action Items

### Robin
- Balance out using examples with providing clear, concise definitions.
- Avoid just saying, "You don't need to know this." Explain why I think you don't need to know this.
- Stop being in a bad mood! (Or maybe let people know that I'm almost always in a good mood, contrary to all appearances!)
- Hang out with the students more!
- Share more anecdotes from my career experience.

### Erica
- Either get more comfortable with live coding or find alternatives, ie. copy and paste with more thorough explanations of what the code is doing
- Be careful about self-deprecating humor than can be interpreted as lack of knowledge
- Organize lessons for greater clarity
- "Let us know more about your strengths"

### Adrian
- Make better effort to get to know students outside of the classroom. More personal interactions.
