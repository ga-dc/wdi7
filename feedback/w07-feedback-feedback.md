# Feedback on Week 6 Feedback

## Action Items for All Instructors
- Supporting instructors will now deliver all homework assignments to ensure all bases are covered with respect to what was delivered in class.
- Avoid Slacking students during lessons/programming unless it's urgent and/or directly related to the activity at hand.
- Add 2 resources for further learning to the end of each lesson plan.
- Meet with whichever instructor had the highest ratings on approachability and develop an improvement plan with them.
- Hold each other accountable on screencasts.
- Add more "Quick References" and walkthroughs at the ends of lesson plans, as in the Rails Deployment lesson plan.

## Action Items for Individual Instructors

### Robin
- Balance out using examples with providing clear, concise definitions.
- Avoid just saying, "You don't need to know this." Explain why I think you don't need to know this.
- Stop being in a bad mood! (Or maybe let people know that I'm almost always in a good mood, contrary to all appearances!)
- Hang out with the students more!
- Share more anecdotes from my career experience.

### Erica
- Either get more comfortable with live coding or find alternatives, ie. copy and paste with more thorough explanations of what the code is doing
- Be careful about self-deprecating humor than can be interpreted as lack of knowledge
- Organize lessons for greater clarity
- "Let us know more about your strengths"

### Adrian
- Make better effort to get to know students outside of the classroom. More personal interactions.
- Work on lesson pacing. Answer questions quicker so that we can get through lesson material.
