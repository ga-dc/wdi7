# How to Ask Questions

This week, rather than ask questions in-person, we ask that you instead submit Github issues on the repository.

The title of the issue should be a brief description of your problem. For example, "Undefined method error when trying to delete something from an array"

Issues should follow this format:
```
I tried ___.
I expected ___ to happen.
___ happened instead.
```

**Please** include the full text of any error messages you're receiving!

[Just click this handy link to create an issue with these blanks inserted for you!](https://github.com/ga-dc/project1/issues/new?title=issue+with+____&body=I+tried+_____.+I+expected+_____+to+happen._____+happened+instead.)

- *Please close your issues when you've received a satisfactory answer*, and let us know what the solution was! We'll close issues that have gone more than 3 hours without any updates.
- Issues can only be reopened by instructors. Therefore, should your issue get closed, please create a *new* issue, and if it's applicable to your previous issue, just include a link to the previous issue.
- If the issue is complicated enough, we'll come find you in person to work through the problem after looking at the Github issue.

## Why?
Many reasons! The biggest is that programmers often have the same question. This way, students with the same question can find their answer in one place.

Additionally, having to articulate the question into words is very helpful in understanding the problem. Some times, simply articulating the question gives you the answer!

Finally, it lets the instructors spread around their bandwidth better!

## How?
Below is a guide for the information that must be included when submitting an issue. It is expected that you will try to debug/solve an issue prior to submitting a request for help on Github.

## Context
When submitting an issue provide some context as to what the problem is. This includes but is not limited to:
- What User Story you are currently working on
- What you are trying to do (in terms of code)
- Detailed description of the bug or error
- Relevant code/files/errors (and screenshots if applicable)
- Gems and/or other technologies being used (if applicable)

## What have you tried?
Give information about what you have done to solve the problem. Including but not limited to:
- Documentation you have looked at
- Steps you have taken to solve the problem
- Resources you have used

## Can students respond to other students' issues?
**YES!**

## All Other Help

If ever you're feeling stuck with **issues that *aren't* technical**, please contact an instructor directly, in-person or via Slack.

Some things that fall into this category:

- You're feeling overhwelmingly stressed and don't know how to alleviate the stress
- Project expectations or instructions are unclear
- You have questions or concerns about your job search
- Your hard drive exploded
- You're having significant interpersonal issues with other people at GA

Your instructors really, really want to know about these things as quickly as possible, and will help you get through any existential or interpersonal challenges to the best of their ability. Technical issues should be kept as Github issues, but if a technical issue is persisting for more than a day or two it can easily become a not-technical issue!
