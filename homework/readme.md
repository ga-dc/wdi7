# Homework

## General Guidelines
- You will be given one or more assignments to finish by Wednesday at 9:00am, and one or more by Friday at 9:00am.
- Unless otherwise directed, each assignment should be forked and cloned from a `ga-dc` repository, and submitted as a pull request to the original `ga-dc` repository from your fork by 9:00am of the day on which it is due.
  - For instructions on pull requests, please see the [homework submission process documentation](https://github.com/ga-dc/wdi7/blob/master/homework/submission-process.md)
- Homework due Wednesday will be checked only for meaningful progress -- that is, for some substantial effort having been made to complete the assignment.
  - You can show meaningful progress without actually completing an assignment. The rubric is simply that you make an effort to complete it.
  - In general, feedback will not be given on these assignments by the grading instructor. That said, the grader will attempt to answer any questions you leave in your pull request, regarding your code, design choices, or the technologies involved.
    - **Please phrase all questions as a question, with a question mark (?).** This serves as a visual cue to the grader.
- Homework due Friday will be graded on the same criteria as homework due Wednesday. The grader **will** leave meaningful feedback on these assignments. Leaving questions in your pull request is still extremely helpful as a way of informing the grader how they should target their feedback.

## Things to note
- We want to be able to give you some flexibility in your homework schedule.
- There will be roughly 2 hours of homework per night. Homework will take more time for some, and less time for others. It is up to you how you want to partition your time for a given exercise.
- These are the expectations that *we*, your instructors, set for you. But ultimately *you* decide is the best investment of your time and energy. Historically, the most successful students have completed most or all of the assignments.
- General Assembly's headquarters in New York publishes a handbook of course guidelines, in which they state that 80% of homework must be completed by all students at minimum. However, they do not define any consequences for not meeting this benchmark. Therefore, the consequences as set by GA's DC branch are that slipping below 80% is a "red flag" to the staff and instructors in terms of student integrity and work ethic, and the staff and/or instructors will meet with the student to develop a personal improvement plan.
