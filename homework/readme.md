# Homework

## General Guidelines
- You will have 2 completeness checks: one on Wednesday and one on Friday.
- You will be given one or more assignments to finish by wednesday/friday at 9:00am.
- This means your pull request should be in by 9. For instructions on pull requests, please see the [homework submission process](https://github.com/ga-dc/wdi7/blob/master/homework/submission-process.md)
- The homework that was turned in by Wednesday will be checked for completeness only. That being said, if you ask for specific feedback on these homeworks, your squad instructor will provide it.
- The homework that was turned in by Friday will be graded for completeness. In addition, your squad instructor will provide meaningful feedback on this homework.

## Things to note
- We want to be able to give you some flexibility in your homework schedule.
- That being said, there will be roughly 2 hours of homework per night. It'll be up to you how you want to partition your time for a given exercise.
- These are the expectations that *we* set for you. But ultimately *you* decide what the best appropriation of your time is. Historically, the most successful students complete most or all of the assignments.
- Additionally, GA, as an organization, publishes a handbook of course guidelines. In this handbook, GA states that 80% of homeworks must be completed at a bare minimum. GADC's policy is that slipping below 80% is a red flag for us to check up on you and develop an improvement plan.
