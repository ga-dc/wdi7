# Homework

## General Guidelines
- You will have 2 completion checks. One on wednesday and one on Friday.
- You will be given one or more assignments to finish by wednesday/friday at 9:00am.
- Means pull request should be in by 9. [Homework submission process](https://github.com/ga-dc/wdi7/blob/master/homework/submission-process.md)
- The homework that was turned in by Wednesday will be checked for completion only. That being said, if you ask for specific feedback for these homeworks, your squad instructor can provide some on a per case basis.
- The homework that was turned in by Friday will be graded for completion and in addition your squad instructor will provide some meaningful feedback.

## Things to note
- We want to be able to give you some flexibility in your homework schedule.
- That being said, there will be roughly 2 hours of homework per night. It'll be up to you how you want to partition your time for a given exercise.
- These are the expectations that *we* set for you. But ultimately *you* decide what the best appropriation of your time is. Historically, the most successful students complete most or all of the assignments.
- Additionally GA, as an organization, puts out a handbook for course guidelines. In it, is a requirement for 80% of homeworks to be completed to serve as a bare minimum guideline. For us, this 80% means its a flag for us to check in with you.
